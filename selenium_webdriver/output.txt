Name : CRISTIANO RONALDOAge : 33DATE OF BIRTH
05 FEBRUARY 1985Details : The Real Madrid forward is Portugal’s captain, most capped player and leading all-time goalscorer. Still supremely fit and as committed as ever, he is more of a penalty box operator these days, having lost none of his scoring touch or his gift for breaking records.
A formidable dribbler and a considerable aerial threat, Ronaldo is noted for his power, speed and instinct, qualities that have seen him named as the world’s best player on five occasions by FIFA. The most special of all the many honours he has won, however, is UEFA EURO 2016, his country’s first major trophy, which he had the honour of raising as skipper. The 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia™ will be his fourth world finals appearance.
